1
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,076
FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
Once upon a time...

2
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:37,706
...there was
an old-fashioned kingdom

3
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,000
bound by tradition.

4
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:44,254
Here, everyone had
a part to play,

5
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:47,466
and they played it
without question.

6
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,010
Little did they know,

7
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:54,223
their world was about to change.

8
00:00:56,642 --> 00:01:00,020
But until it did, y'all...

9
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:02,314
this village
of hardworking citizens

10
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:06,276
moved to the same beat
day after day,

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,863
generation after generation.

12
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:38,225
for a better way

13
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,269
-

14
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,897
of the rhythm nation

15
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:48,694
the rhythm nation

16
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,696
FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
And over here

17
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:54,408
is where our story begins,
at the humble home

18
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:56,952
of a practical woman
named Vivian,

19
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,079
who was alone again

20
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:02,624
after the death
of her second husband.

21
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:08,463
a better way of life

22
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:12,426
Vivian's daughters:

23
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,054
the obnoxious Malvolia

24
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,182
and the self-absorbed Narissa.

25
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,976
She cray.

26
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:25,105
-

27
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:28,609
of the rhythm nation

28
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,361
-Um, yeah.

29
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,280
They can be a lot.

30
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,990
I'm winning!

31
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:37,034
-Whee!

32
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,829
And down here,

33
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,457
in this dingy basement,

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,667
the stepdaughter, Ella.

35
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:49,421
Or, as her stepsisters
call her, Cinderella,

36
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:53,050
because her skin
was often besmirched by cinders

37
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,928
and her stepsisters
were not that clever.

38
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,597
Right now,
she's dreaming of a world

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,309
in which she can live her life
any way she wants.

40
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,062
Uh, watch it now. You about
to roll over on that...

41
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:07,147
-...pin.

42
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:11,276
the future holds

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,572
your head up to the sky

44
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,783
cause you tears

45
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:23,914
unless you try

46
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,749
you gotta be bad

47
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:28,961
you gotta be wiser

48
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:31,463
you gotta be tough

49
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,968
you gotta be calm

50
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:49,773
We are a part
of the rhythm nation

51
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,403
-

52
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:57,656
if you can't stand the pace

53
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,033
-

54
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:08,041
staring you in the face

55
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,047
you gotta be bold

56
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,719
you gotta be tough

57
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,764
you gotta be calm

58
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,653
-Smashed it!
-Perfectamundo.

59
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:39,197
Take that, birds.

60
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,241
Good morning,
my beady-eyed friends.

61
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,993
You hungry?

62
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:44,244
-Oh, yeah.
-Nod your head, mates.

63
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,455
-All she hears is squeaks.
-Mm. Come to papa.

64
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:47,789
- Ooh.

65
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,461
you gotta be bold

66
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,588
gotta be wiser

67
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,882
you gotta be tough

68
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,759
gotta be stronger

69
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,428
you gotta be calm

70
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,180
keep it together

71
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,190
-

72
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:15,233
a better way of life?

73
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,194
-

74
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,321
the rhythm nation

75
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,031
-

76
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:22,908
are we looking for

77
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,998
-

78
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,168
-

79
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,878
-

80
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,922
-

81
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,257
are we looking for

82
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,176
-

83
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,014
of the rhythm nation

84
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:55,982
all I know is love

85
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:18,004
Unhappy with the tea,
Stepmother?

86
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:21,633
Imagine if you served such swill
to your future husband.

87
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,885
How long would it take
for him to abandon you?

88
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,847
To understand
just how worthless you are?

89
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,099
Learn from this
and never do it again.

90
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:31,476
I thought she was
rather hard on her.

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,271
-I thought she could've
gone harder. -Quiet.

92
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,690
Cinderella, now that
you're an orphan,

93
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,900
it's important for you
to remember that

94
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,319
it's only my love for
your father-- rest his soul--

95
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,321
that stands between you
and a life on the street.

96
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:46,658
Yes, of course. And that's why
I'm so thankful for...

97
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,451
You could be so pretty...

98
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,871
if you took even a second
to comb that hair of yours.

99
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:01,214
Oh, you're in.
Good morning, Ella.

100
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,216
Mr. Cecil.

101
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,467
It's Mr. Cecil!

102
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,929
I'm curious--
do you really need that cane?

103
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:09,973
No, but chicks dig it.

104
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,183
-Oh.
-THOMAS: Vivian.

105
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,350
Thomas.

106
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,602
And all the girls.

107
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:14,978
Lucky Thomas.

108
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,479
-There they go.

109
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:17,772
Freshly picked from the farm.

110
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:21,318
Parsnips, turnips, rutabagas.

111
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,653
The fleshiest fruit
of the earth.

112
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,447
Would you like to come in?

113
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,283
Yes... N-No.

114
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,369
No, no, not today. Yeah, I just
wanted to check in on you

115
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:34,331
and make sure that your, uh,
blossoming daughters

116
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,249
are, uh...

117
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,168
um, managing.

118
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,419
Makes my skin crawl.

119
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,795
-Mine, too.
-I'm into it.

120
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,963
All right, then.

121
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,965
Now I've got this mental image

122
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,927
to nourish me through the day,
I'll be going.

123
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:51,431
CINDERELLA:
Ew.

124
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,979
Fortune has smiled
upon this house.

125
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,690
My daughters have a suitor.

126
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,359
You mean this daughter
has a suitor.

127
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,902
The others have
heartache and jealousy.

128
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,403
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

129
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,448
Yeah, no, I am not
a match for Thomas.

130
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,284
Well, you must make yourself
a match for someone.

131
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,286
Yes.

132
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,413
I understand, Stepmother.

133
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,502
Here comes our girl.

134
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,878
Oh, boy, she's got heavy feet.

135
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,514
JAMES:
Oh, I slept in that fabric.

136
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,224
JOHN:
Shh!

137
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,947
a world outside

138
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,624
that understands

139
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,584
the whispers

140
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,962
you're walking in

141
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:12,429
staring at me

142
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:15,098
I know who I'm gonna be

143
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,104
it's gonna wake up and see

144
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,731
-Ooh.
-Ooh, nice.

145
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:33,742
a shot in the dark

146
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:39,956
to be wrong

147
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,258
know my name

148
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:56,097
is always racing

149
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,475
round the room

150
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,772
I don't wanna do

151
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,775
staring at me

152
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,819
I know who I'm gonna be

153
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,587
a shot in the dark

154
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,173
-

155
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,009
-Oh!

156
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,937
know my name

157
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,109
now and then

158
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,781
that I could be

159
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:02,747
all along in her head

160
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:08,128
is hard to see

161
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:23,017
a shot in the dark

162
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,482
-

163
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:32,569
-

164
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,658
-

165
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:44,372
know my name, yeah

166
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:51,463
know my name.

167
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,775
God.

168
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,777
That's disgusting.

169
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,739
Well, thank you for coming in.

170
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,325
Well, before your aide-de-camp
loses a hand...

171
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:25,079
This is called a world map.

172
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:28,541
Now, take a look
at this blob here and here.

173
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,587
If we marry,
our blobs would join up,

174
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,381
and we would control the world

175
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:38,009
all the way
to this huge sea monster.

176
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,052
Mm, the sea monster.

177
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:40,303
You know, I really just

178
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,888
don't have the time
in my schedule

179
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,598
to be controlling
these far-off lands.

180
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,808
I am just too busy.

181
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,227
LAURA:
Doing what?

182
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,230
You spent three whole days
drinking and foxhunting.

183
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,523
That was a lot of hard work.

184
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,107
Now, you try tracking a fox
when drunk.

185
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:55,109
-It's impossible.
-No, it isn't!

186
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:57,529
You didn't.

187
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,280
-Do not hit me, sweet prince!
-

188
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,074
No, no, no, no!

189
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,577
I promise, milord,

190
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,206
you can keep gallivanting here
with your merry bros,

191
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,500
and I'll have other interests.

192
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,752
We never have to be together,
except for royal events,

193
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,004
war planning
and when we have to engage

194
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,048
in the disgusting practice
of making a son.

195
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,716
WILBUR:
Yeah?

196
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,552
Your offer is intriguing,

197
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:24,556
but I have no intention
on settling down anytime soon.

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,810
I see.

199
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,482
He's not working
with much upstairs,

200
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,442
and I'd be surprised
if it was different elsewhere.

201
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,403
-She knows what I'm
talking about. -

202
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,457
yeah, I took over from Barry

203
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,668
but he died of dysentery

204
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,588
the announcements of the day

205
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,299
you like the way they play

206
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:01,342
for you ladies and gents

207
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:04,012
is soon gonna commence

208
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,472
better than the shire fair

209
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:09,017
royal family will be there

210
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,978
-

211
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,980
and our Queen Beatrice

212
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,566
you don't wanna miss

213
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,110
Princess Gwen, no doubt

214
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,863
and the old roll out

215
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,454
Are they rosy yet?

216
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,039
The pain is quite terrific.

217
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:33,750
-Ladies, are we ready?

218
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,543
What in God's name
are you doing?

219
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:37,253
Bringing color to her cheeks.

220
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:38,963
-Good idea.

221
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:41,257
-Where's Cinderella?
-She's still in that basement.

222
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:44,385
-Cinderella! -I'm starting
to think she doesn't like us.

223
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:46,262
Cinderella!
Girls, can you help me?

224
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:48,139
ALL:
Cinderella!

225
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,809
STEPSISTERS
Cinderella!

226
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:57,523
-VIVIAN: Cinderella!
-STEPSISTERS: Cinderella!

227
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,485
You called?

228
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:01,694
Yes, stepchild.

229
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:02,904
Don't be dense.

230
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,197
I'm sorry, I-I was just...

231
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,365
About to make an excuse?

232
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:06,783
I could truly care less.

233
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,160
Grab your things.
Try not to make us late.

234
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,204
The changing of the guard
waits for no one.

235
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,413
Cinderella?

236
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,915
Yeah?

237
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,917
Do you think I look pretty?

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,253
I think you look so pretty.

239
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,255
But...

240
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,966
honestly, who cares
what I think?

241
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,968
Who cares what anyone thinks?

242
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:28,680
What matters is how you feel
when you look in the mirror.

243
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,348
That's deep.

244
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,434
How do I feel...

245
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,520
about myself?

246
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,231
Uh...

247
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,070
Yeah, I do.

248
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:45,697
I feel pretty.

249
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,407
Cool.

250
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:51,327
You have dirt on your face.

251
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,167
Please, girls,
we're going to be late.

252
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:59,585
What is that?

253
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,296
It's a dress.

254
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,589
I made it.

255
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,049
-Why?
-I don't know.

256
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,300
I-I just thought,

257
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,010
since the whole kingdom
will be there today,

258
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:11,806
I could find someone
who will maybe buy it.

259
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:19,439
To think that any girl,
let alone you,

260
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,649
would have the audacity
to engage

261
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,026
in matters of business,
it's insane.

262
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,821
I will not have you
embarrassing this household

263
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,698
with your blasphemy.

264
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:30,867
Don't ever let me catch you
trying such nonsense again.

265
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,454
Put the dress down.

266
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,497
Yes, Stepmother.

267
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,628
Good.

268
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:45,256
Now... shoulders back.

269
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,758
-No slouching.

270
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,677
And smile.

271
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,430
Every girl is worth more
when she smiles.

272
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,294
What are you doing?

273
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:27,715
I am stewing in my own anger.

274
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,716
Oh, okay.

275
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,551
You turned down the daughter

276
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,969
of Lord Reginald.

277
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,262
I guess she wasn't the one.

278
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,680
She was!

279
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:37,391
I would've had control
of all the territories

280
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,560
right up to the domain
of the sea monster.

281
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:41,771
Well, perhaps you should marry
the sea monster, Robert.

282
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,439
I would have to have
grandmother's ring resized.

283
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,400
You keep overlooking
his behavior,

284
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,402
-and he'll never grow out of it.
-Stop.

285
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:49,987
He's gonna make a fine king.

286
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,324
Is it me,

287
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,245
or is your throne
just a little bit taller

288
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:58,663
-than it was yesterday?
-

289
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,998
-I mean, it really looks...
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.

290
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:02,208
-Quite a bit.
-And even if it is,

291
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,502
I have every right
to make it taller.

292
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,628
I'm king.

293
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:08,089
Mm. Yes.

294
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:10,800
And I am ridiculous.

295
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,095
If you need me,
I shall be in my chambers.

296
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,930
Brushing my hair.

297
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,807
Until it all falls out.

298
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,226
So we good?
'Cause I got a thing.

299
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,395
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

300
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,147
You're bringing shame
on this family, Robert.

301
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,233
Have you seen this?

302
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,777
ROBERT: "The Roundabout Players
present The King's Idiot Son."

303
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:31,612
Ooh, do you think
we can still get tickets?

304
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:33,072
I'm becoming a laughingstock.

305
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,657
I think you're overreacting.

306
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,325
Well, why don't you ask
the Roundabout Players

307
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,577
if I'm overreacting?

308
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,203
They are currently

309
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,831
in a dark windowless room
under the castle.

310
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,960
You can't leave actors alone
in a basement without attention.

311
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,044
They'll die!

312
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,588
When you marry,
you'll settle down.

313
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:50,673
You'll stop behaving
like my idiot son,

314
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,341
and the perception
of the people will be

315
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:54,218
that you take the crown
seriously.

316
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:55,511
-You can't control me.
-

317
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:56,929
Oh, that's exactly
what I can do.

318
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:58,389
That's the perk
of being the king.

319
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,765
But I feel nothing
for these women.

320
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:00,933
It's crazy to think
I'm actually gonna

321
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,018
fall in love with one of them.

322
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,269
Kings marry for power,

323
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,645
-not for love.
-

324
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,272
Oh, well, it's perfect then
that Mother came with

325
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,274
three castles
and a hundred horses,

326
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,442
or I suppose
I never would've been born!

327
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,152
-Silence!
-

328
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:22,788
Don't talk about
what you don't understand. Hmm?

329
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:27,043
Continue to defy me,
and just out of spite,

330
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:31,130
I'll give it all-- the crown,

331
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,049
the palace,

332
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:36,135
everything-- to your sister.

333
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,179
CHOIR:

334
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,056
Leave us, Gwen.

335
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,355
Sorry.

336
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,065
I would be embarrassed

337
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:52,443
if I wasn't so bored
with my life.

338
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,321
But since I'm here,
I would love to stay

339
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,156
and help sort out
this whole crown issue.

340
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,699
You've been excused, Gwen.

341
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,952
Right.

342
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:03,829
But would this be a good time
for me to mention

343
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:06,248
how the kingdom could use
the power of the wind

344
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,917
-instead of burning
filthy coal? -Go!

345
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,298
Father, you know how badly
I want to be king.

346
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:18,094
Now, to make sure your nuptials

347
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:21,222
are done properly and on my
schedule, we shall hold a ball.

348
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,723
-No.

349
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,519
Yes. We'll invite
every woman of worth.

350
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,355
You'll dance.
You'll be charming.

351
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,815
You shall find a bride.

352
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,066
-Hmm?
-No, no, no.

353
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,485
D-Dancing at these things
is so... mannered.

354
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,486
And formal.

355
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,779
We look like fools!

356
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,072
Of course we do.

357
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,490
But women love it.

358
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,159
Good God, Robert,
if a rich man ever lost a woman,

359
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:43,953
it was to a man who could dance.

360
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,998
Why do I have to explain
everything to you?

361
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:48,124
This is insane!

362
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:49,959
I can't just pick
some bride at a ball.

363
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,377
And then what?

364
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,838
We're-we're supposed
to grow old together?

365
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,381
Into our 40s?

366
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:58,217
I mean, what are we even
gonna talk about?

367
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,011
You will go to the ball.

368
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,763
You will find someone.

369
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,098
That's an order.

370
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,518
Now, go dress.

371
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,855
I expect you to look sharp for
the changing of the guard. Hmm?

372
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,401
Nothing?

373
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:18,696
-

374
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:20,781
Don't be late.

375
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,783
"Don't be late."

376
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:27,329
Well?

377
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:29,915
You heard the king.

378
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,449
Each morning I get up,
I die a little

379
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,242
-

380
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,955
in the mirror and cry

381
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,083
Lord,
what you're doing to me

382
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,335
-

383
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,964
get no relief

384
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,597
-

385
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,484
-

386
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,780
in my bones

387
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:46,283
-

388
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:49,453
-

389
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,288
-

390
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:52,748
-

391
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:56,127
from my eyes, Lord

392
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,796
-

393
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:09,056
-

394
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,560
-

395
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,562
-

396
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,606
-

397
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,402
to put me down

398
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,655
-

399
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,032
of water in my brain

400
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:52,099
to love

401
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:53,809
-

402
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,394
-

403
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,896
-

404
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,314
-

405
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,149
-

406
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,609
-

407
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,277
-

408
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,653
-

409
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,530
-

410
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,282
-

411
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,826
-

412
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,996
-

413
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,581
-

414
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,124
-Dude.
-

415
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,596
Get off my dad!

416
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,765
-

417
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,729
Oh, good.

418
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,148
Everyone's staring at me,
just as I'd hoped.

419
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:44,151
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

420
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,903
It's just really hard
to see in the back.

421
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,948
Might I suggest you put
some bleachers back there?

422
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,908
Give us short peasants a chance?

423
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,411
"I hereby decree
all short peasants

424
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,413
shall be pardoned by the king."

425
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,500
ROWAN:
Get down now!

426
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,378
He doesn't-- He didn't think
that was funny, did he?

427
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,545
Oop, bird poo.

428
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,475
-

429
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,394
-

430
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,481
- Excuse me, sorry.

431
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,922
I'll play your silly game,

432
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:50,259
but only if every girl in the
kingdom is invited to the ball,

433
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,885
regardless of wealth or stature.

434
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:55,848
Marrying a commoner
is not at all what I meant.

435
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,641
Father, please.

436
00:25:57,725 --> 00:26:00,811
Deep down,
you need me to be king.

437
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,022
What a black mark
it'll be on your name

438
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,440
if I don't continue the line.

439
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:06,692
So, what option
do you really have?

440
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:12,948
Too subtle?

441
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,575
Not subtle enough?

442
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,577
Fine.

443
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,078
So it shall be.

444
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:30,924
Don't even think about it, Gwen.

445
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:33,052
You're literally
not even going to let me

446
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:34,720
have a seat at the table?

447
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,139
I don't make up the rules.
I'm just the king.

448
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,849
Right.

449
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,089
So you're just going to
wander about until you find her,

450
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,590
wearing that
ridiculous disguise?

451
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,510
It works, Wilbur.

452
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:15,636
Nobody recognizes me.

453
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,221
Lucky for you.

454
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,555
Ah, no, too much.

455
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,141
What? The-the makeup?

456
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,227
-No, you look like a pirate.
-You look like a pirate.

457
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,187
Unnecessary.

458
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,439
You know, I can't believe
that you're willing to sully

459
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:30,401
the dignity of the royal family
for some commoner.

460
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,610
Wilbur, you sound old.

461
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,820
-I'm just...
-Just what?

462
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,279
She's-she's beautiful.

463
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,532
She's witty. She's fearless.

464
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,617
I mean, holy hell, did you see
the way she talked to my father?

465
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,411
-So mouthy.
-And glorious.

466
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:41,453
I must know her.

467
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:42,955
So, yes, I'm gonna
walk the streets

468
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,749
until I find her,
reveal my true self,

469
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,543
and then personally
invite her to the ball.

470
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,253
Unless, of course, it turns out

471
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,463
that she's got a couple bats
in the old belfry,

472
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:54,341
in which case, I will realize
that my feelings were incorrect

473
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:56,468
and...

474
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:57,886
slowly back away.

475
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,932
It is your belfry that has bats.

476
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,143
I do not have a single bat
in my belfry.

477
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,727
No, there are multiple bats
in your belfry.

478
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:07,312
I am the prince, and I say

479
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:09,106
that your belfry
is the one with the bats.

480
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,441
Well, I'm the prince's
best friend,

481
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,235
and I say that yours
is one with the bats.

482
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,156
I'm your best friend, right?

483
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:20,909
I have lots of friends.

484
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,330
Of course you're my best friend.

485
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,623
Yeah, thought so.

486
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,459
Beautiful human.

487
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,003
Bats.

488
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,220
Look at that.

489
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,763
Wow.

490
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:42,806
You know, it's a good thing

491
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,641
Stepmother never
comes down here.

492
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,894
She does not approve of pets.

493
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,353
Or charity.

494
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,606
Or kindness of any sort, really.

495
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,651
And she'd definitely
stop you from doing

496
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:58,489
whatever it is you're doing
right now, which is beautiful.

497
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,575
And only a little bit gross.

498
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,035
A little bit? It's revolting.

499
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,703
She needs to throw that out.

500
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,330
-I don't mind it.
-CINDERELLA: All right.

501
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,627
Because life
outside this basement...

502
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,254
...starts right now.

503
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,342
Girls, it shouldn't be so hard.

504
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,426
But it is.

505
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,969
Work is always hard.

506
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,934
Why are we doing
Cinderella work?

507
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,685
Because I want you to see what
you're in for if you don't marry

508
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,062
a man of means, like Thomas.

509
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,230
Thomas.

510
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,689
He's quite the catch.

511
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,566
Too bad he hasn't
been back in days.

512
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,817
Well, if it's not Thomas,

513
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,194
then it will just have to be
some other man.

514
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,446
Like him?

515
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,031
VIVIAN:
 No.

516
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,157
No, no, no, no, no.

517
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,284
Do not cast your eyes
on some farm boy.

518
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,120
In this life,
you must marry rich.

519
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:50,207
Get yourself a man
who can pay for everything,

520
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,459
and then you will never
so much as have to hang

521
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:53,877
your wet undergarments again.

522
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,712
-I'm-a go see
if he needs a wife. -No.

523
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,172
Farm boy is off the table.

524
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,717
No matter how toothsome
he may be, and...

525
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,056
...and toothsome he is.

526
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,350
Ew, what does that mean?

527
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,018
It's how old people
say "poppin'."

528
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,687
-Ah.
-VIVIAN: You must always think

529
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,022
and act like this.

530
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,902
some boys hug me

531
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:26,201
proper credit

532
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,582
-

533
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:32,916
-

534
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,339
with the cold, hard cash

535
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:46,930
in a material world

536
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,104
-

537
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,067
But what about romance?

538
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,235
Oh, please.

539
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:03,238
Listen up.

540
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,831
raise my interest

541
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:17,127
-

542
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,296
-

543
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,134
-

544
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:28,138
who save their pennies

545
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:34,102
in a material world

546
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,566
-Get it?
-Yes!

547
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,820
in a material world

548
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:50,702
in a material world

549
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:57,250
in a material world

550
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:00,128
-

551
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,505
-

552
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,843
-

553
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,864
CINDERELLA:
"And Sons."

554
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,326
"Y Hermanos."

555
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,370
"And Sons."

556
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,386
-Lovely day for a stroll.
-Mm-hmm.

557
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,221
I just adore your headpiece.

558
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,724
You know, it'd go beautifully
with this dress I made.

559
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,976
-I can give you a fair price.
-Shame on you.

560
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,103
Trying to sell me a dress
you clearly stole

561
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,521
from the lady you serve.

562
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,982
No, I-I stitched this
with my own two hands.

563
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,484
I should alert the king's guard
and have you arrested,

564
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:05,777
you street urchin.

565
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,904
Arrest--?

566
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,118
Okay.

567
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,748
CINDERELLA:
Ladies and gentlemen!

568
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,792
For a mere
five pieces of silver,

569
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:23,962
who would like to purchase
this one-of-a-kind,

570
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,964
completely non-stolen dress?

571
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,507
Here's a laugh.

572
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,010
This girl fancies herself
a businessman.

573
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:36,641
Don't-Don't listen to him.
This is a one-of-a-kind design.

574
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,185
I'd stop while
you're ahead, missy.

575
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,896
-Who on earth do you think
you are? -Honestly.

576
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,106
But...

577
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,025
Sounds like you need
to lower your price.

578
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,111
Sir, please don't pile on, okay?

579
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,321
Not today.

580
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:50,864
No, no, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful dress.

581
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,158
Right?
I should be allowed to sell it.

582
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,285
Sure, but women can't own shops.

583
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,412
-Uh-huh. And that's unfair.
-Is it?

584
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:58,914
Yes!

585
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,249
Us ladies give birth.

586
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,834
We run households.

587
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,336
Surely we can run a business.

588
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,962
Can't be that hard.

589
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,048
I mean,
wouldn't it just be great

590
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,508
if I could have my own shop?

591
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:10,550
Right here.

592
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,677
I could hang my garments
on that side.

593
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:16,431
And I'd say things like,
"Thank you. Come again."

594
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,433
Or, "Hot enough
out there for ya?"

595
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,893
What?

596
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,311
It's banter.

597
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:22,521
It breaks the ice.

598
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,105
Okay. What am I doing?
I'm going home.

599
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,565
-I'm talking to a stranger.
-I'll take it.

600
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,900
Take what?

601
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,652
The dress. I'll buy it.

602
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,695
Is this pity?

603
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,531
Are you doing this
'cause you feel sorry for me?

604
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,074
-Because that's really nice,
but... -No.

605
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,744
I'm just trying to do my part
to correct a flawed system.

606
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,455
What's your price?
I mean, the brooch alone...

607
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,332
Oh, the brooch.

608
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,458
That was my mother's.

609
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,669
I never knew her,
but I want to believe

610
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:49,923
she'd rather me have my dreams
than her brooch, so...

611
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,511
I'll pay triple
what you're asking.

612
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:56,721
You?

613
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:00,225
Don't judge a book
by its cover, milady.

614
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,944
there'll be a ball

615
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,988
night could change your life

616
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,031
finally find his wife

617
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,241
all the single ladies

618
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,369
to the ball is invited

619
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,037
So take a bath,
do your hair

620
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,747
paint your nails

621
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,541
to impress, yes

622
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,256
yo, uh

623
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,592
underqualified, nah

624
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:38,597
yo, uh

625
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,390
y'all, uh

626
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:51,151
Prince Robert needs a ball
to find his bride.

627
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,069
What is wrong with him?

628
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,238
Maybe nothing's wrong with him.

629
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,698
I heard he just wants to allow

630
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,325
anyone the chance
to fall in love with him.

631
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,368
How conceited is that?

632
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,456
Rumors must be true.

633
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,625
What, pray tell, are the rumors?

634
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,627
You know, that he serves
no real function

635
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,045
other than to wreck things.

636
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:13,298
That the real brains
of the family is Princess Gwen.

637
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,341
Duh.

638
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:16,092
Oh, and that he's a mama's boy

639
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,969
who I heard, from time to time,

640
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,554
still gets spanked
on the tush-tush.

641
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,140
-Not true at all, though.
-Ah, maybe.

642
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,808
Sounds like a vicious lie to me.

643
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,977
So does this mean
you're not coming to the ball?

644
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:27,228
No way.

645
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,105
I mean, the whole thing
is weird and antiquated.

646
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,315
Not my thing.

647
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,900
Nice to meet you.

648
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:35,862
You know, we live in
a very old-fashioned kingdom,

649
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,281
but the ball, I mean,

650
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,034
there'll be guests there
from all over the world,

651
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,578
open-minded people
with cash to spare.

652
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,914
Now, I know them.

653
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,415
I can introduce you
if you'd like.

654
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,210
Why would you do that?

655
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,711
I mean, you just met me.

656
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,423
Let's just say
I know what it feels like

657
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:58,677
to not quite fit into the crate
you were born into.

658
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,054
And I... I believe in you.

659
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,184
Then, yes.

660
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,268
I'll go.

661
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,145
Huzzah!

662
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,689
What?

663
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:15,402
I heard a proper person say that
one time when he was excited.

664
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,571
Ah, look who's been around
a proper person.

665
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:19,990
Just once.

666
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,950
I once shared an apple
with a goat named King Rowan.

667
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,660
Well, I'm sure the prince
will definitely pick you.

668
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,662
I doubt it. I'm dirty.

669
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,664
I smell like a basement.

670
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,332
My best friends are mice.
It's a whole thing.

671
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,334
I-I will just find you
at the ball.

672
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,504
Thank you for this.

673
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:36,673
You're welcome.

674
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,843
Hope the dress fits!

675
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,803
Gonna try it on
as soon as I get home.

676
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,725
He's kind of cute.

677
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,028
Give me your
finest fabrics, please, sir.

678
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,658
Yes!

679
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,711
This is it.

680
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,298
This is my chance.

681
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,969
Hmm.

682
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:38,109
from where I stay?

683
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:46,910
I'll choose another way?

684
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,787
-ROBERT:

685
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,582
what everybody else doing

686
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:56,836
what they all do

687
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,257
how far would I grow?

688
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,176
this road of mine

689
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,765
we could be something

690
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,975
-

691
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,727
No, no, no, no,
that's wrong

692
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,774
the things that I can't see?

693
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,609
Ow!

694
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,945
-

695
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,832
that I can't see

696
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,474
-In your dreams!
-In your face!

697
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,935
-Girls, please!
-ROWAN: I assure you,

698
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:57,272
Robert will cease
to be a distraction.

699
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:59,399
hope you don't look back

700
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,111
control your life

701
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,613
-

702
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:07,448
and don't let go

703
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:09,492
compare you, no

704
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,161
you're not alone

705
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,957
-

706
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,460
I'm wrong, wrong

707
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:23,339
right, right

708
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:27,385
I'm wrong, wrong

709
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,931
-ROBERT:

710
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,434
I'm wrong, wrong

711
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,644
CINDERELLA:

712
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,771
right, right

713
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:40,940
-

714
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,942
-

715
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,782
Thomas.

716
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:51,284
May I come in?

717
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,789
-

718
00:40:56,873 --> 00:41:00,293
be something for real?

719
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:01,794
yeah, yeah, oh

720
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:04,839
-

721
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,466
-Not too fast.
-

722
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,136
yeah, yeah, oh

723
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,765
-

724
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,725
-

725
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:18,186
-

726
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:23,733
that I can't see

727
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,486
-

728
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:32,909
be something for real?

729
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:43,544
the things that I can't

730
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,552
Sorry, ma'am.

731
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:54,889
NARISSA:
I feel great about myself.

732
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,185
All right, turn around.
Let me see.

733
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,856
Oh, my.

734
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,694
After tonight, one of you may
very well become a princess.

735
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,780
-You really think so?

736
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,282
I do.

737
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,701
And after all the bad things
that have happened in our lives,

738
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:16,744
wouldn't it be nice
if we had something good?

739
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,298
It's over. I'm eating a muffin
and going to bed.

740
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:29,924
No.

741
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:32,802
Did you make that dress?

742
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,012
Mm-hmm.

743
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:35,930
I suppose it's nice.

744
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,348
It's tasteful.

745
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:38,891
Thank you.

746
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,519
I'm sorry, I should have said
something earlier,

747
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:43,855
but, Cinderella, you don't need
to go to the ball.

748
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:46,357
What do you mean?

749
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:47,567
Of course I do.

750
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,861
No, it's for girls
who are unbetrothed,

751
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:52,739
and as of this morning,
you are spoken for.

752
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,575
That's impossible.

753
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,285
I speak for me.

754
00:42:57,368 --> 00:43:00,788
No, Thomas has expressed
his intentions to marry you.

755
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:01,873
CINDERELLA:
Thomas?

756
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:04,083
But I don't want
to marry Thomas.

757
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,793
-I reject his intentions.
-Hush now.

758
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,920
Women who are promised away
do not go to balls.

759
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,715
Take off that dress
and go back to your basement.

760
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:11,924
No, but...

761
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,926
Please, Stepmother,
I have to go.

762
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,386
My future depends on it.

763
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,597
I-I spent weeks making
this dress so that I could

764
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,515
show women from
all over the world that I...

765
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,480
Why would you...?

766
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:28,399
Ow.

767
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,984
You are to stay home

768
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,904
and find a way
to be that man's bride.

769
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:37,492
Upset me further, and you will
have no one in this life.

770
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,303
Poor Ella.

771
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,055
She was so looking forward
to that ball.

772
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:02,141
-It's a shame.
-Absolutely devastating.

773
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,608
Uh, guys?

774
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:18,825
Gosh, that's beautiful.

775
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,576
What an improvement.

776
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:24,997
Adventure time.
Let's follow it.

777
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,499
Right behind you.

778
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,292
I really shouldn't run
on a full stomach, but okay.

779
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:40,555
staring at me

780
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:05,288
a shot in the dark

781
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:11,252
to be wrong

782
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,860
You did it.

783
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,737
Well done, my friend.

784
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:05,848
Work! Yes!

785
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:08,976
Now, this is how
you make an entrance.

786
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:15,149
Allow me to introduce myself.

787
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:18,402
I am your Fabulous Godmother.

788
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:20,905
-But-but why?
-Baby, you saved me.

789
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:24,575
And so now I'm here to save you

790
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,744
by sending you to that ball.

791
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,454
Well, I'm not allowed
at the ball.

792
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:29,956
And, quite frankly,

793
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:31,582
I think you're a figment
of my imagination.

794
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,792
Okay, let's not ruin

795
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,210
this incredibly magical moment
with reason.

796
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,420
Do you want to go
to that ball and meet

797
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:38,214
a bunch of rich people
who will change your life?

798
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,423
Yes, I was just crying

799
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:41,050
and singing about it
like two minutes ago.

800
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:42,301
Okay, so that would be
an affirmative?

801
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:43,511
Yes.

802
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:44,720
I can't hear you.

803
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,013
-Yes!
-Like you mean it.

804
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:47,098
Yes!

805
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:50,142
Then go you shall.

806
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,106
-

807
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:57,400
take you very far

808
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:07,326
what it seems

809
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,455
come into view

810
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,418
-Ooh.

811
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:21,966
to carry on

812
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:24,969
big and strong

813
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:28,806
Uh...

814
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:33,561
You can't wear that to the ball.

815
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:35,354
I know.

816
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:39,233
Oh. Look at that.

817
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,068
This is... this is different.

818
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:43,029
-I've never seen anything
like this. -Okay, okay, dang.

819
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:45,406
You said you wanted
to be a businesswoman.

820
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,827
Think, Fab G, think.

821
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:56,834
Mm.

822
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,010
Did I miss...?

823
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:09,305
Wait...

824
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:10,806
for it.

825
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:19,774
No, no, no, that design
is pure fantasy.

826
00:48:19,857 --> 00:48:21,233
I don't even know
if it's possible.

827
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:24,153
Hush. It's magic time.

828
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,632
You know, the wind is
really picking up.

829
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:46,842
I feel like maybe we should
take this inside or...

830
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:23,754
This is gorgeous!

831
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,173
Yas, future queen! Yas!

832
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:28,175
What's that, Prince?

833
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:29,969
You'd like to dance?

834
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,095
Ah-ah-ah.

835
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:33,097
Get in line, Your Highness.

836
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,181
Hold on.

837
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,561
Where am I going?

838
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,608
Wow.

839
00:49:44,692 --> 00:49:46,777
They're beautiful.

840
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:48,779
They're glass?

841
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,156
Any way you can make 'em
more comfortable?

842
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,533
-No.
-But you're magic.

843
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:54,118
Women's shoes are as they are.

844
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:56,078
Even magic has its limits.

845
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:58,372
-Oh.
-

846
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:00,583
Ow.

847
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,418
How am I gonna...?

848
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,795
Feet don't work like this.

849
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:08,883
Getting better.

850
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:11,469
Oh. Oh.

851
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,804
I'm doing it.
-Oh!

852
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:25,733
a shining star

853
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:30,070
-

854
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:34,825
-Go on with your bad self.
-

855
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:37,411
Oh, um, I don't suppose

856
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,705
you could actually get me
to the ball, could you?

857
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:48,547
-Ho...
-Ly...

858
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:50,216
Fudge.

859
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:54,929
You need footmen.

860
00:50:56,347 --> 00:50:57,515
ROMESH:
He sees us.

861
00:50:57,598 --> 00:50:59,183
Well, well, well.

862
00:51:00,768 --> 00:51:04,063
Look at you little
disgusting creatures.

863
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,898
You will do.

864
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,983
-JOHN: Do for what?
-ROMESH: Yeah, do for what?

865
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:09,193
-ROMESH: Do for what?
-JOHN: Do for what?

866
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:11,612
JAMES and JOHN:
Do for what?!

867
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,697
-Whoa.
-JAMES: Where's my tail?

868
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:15,574
I-I can't balance
without my tail.

869
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:17,117
CINDERELLA:
You're boys?

870
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:19,286
I always assumed you were girls.

871
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,664
And why would you assume that?

872
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:25,000
Because everyone knows mice
are girls and rats are boys.

873
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:27,711
Well, how do you think
rats have more rats?

874
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:31,298
Moving away from that.

875
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:33,425
Now, the three of you are
going to make sure that

876
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:35,261
this beautiful young lady
gets to the ball.

877
00:51:35,344 --> 00:51:37,137
We're going to the palace?

878
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:38,681
But we don't even know
where the palace is.

879
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:40,224
We've not been past
the front yard.

880
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,976
JAMES: Well, except for that
one time when we had to leave

881
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,435
'cause snakes got
into the house.

882
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:45,312
-The what?
-Oh.

883
00:51:45,396 --> 00:51:47,565
Yeah, no, we were gonna
tell you, but...

884
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:49,191
FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
Okay, focus, people.

885
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,277
You are to make sure that
she gets to the ball,

886
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,404
and that is that.

887
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,081
-

888
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:06,375
-

889
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:09,879
-Tell 'em, Fab G.

890
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:11,839
-

891
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:16,468
-

892
00:52:16,552 --> 00:52:18,929
-

893
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:21,557
a shining star

894
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,517
-

895
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:25,853
-

896
00:52:29,523 --> 00:52:30,816
what you can truly be

897
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:39,575
It's time to go.

898
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,994
Yep, yep.
We should... we should...

899
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,246
What am I doing?

900
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,998
My stepmother will disown me.

901
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:48,417
I mean, she'd throw me out
into the street.

902
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,920
She told me she would.
She told me she would do that.

903
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:52,671
Don't worry.
As long as you're in that gown,

904
00:52:52,755 --> 00:52:54,298
no one will be able
to recognize you.

905
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,883
Actually, that's not good.

906
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:57,885
I'm meeting a stranger there
who's offered to help me.

907
00:52:57,968 --> 00:52:59,887
My, my.

908
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,764
You are high-maintenance.

909
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:03,515
Fine.

910
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,226
He alone will be the exception.

911
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:09,355
But when the magic wears off...

912
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:10,898
Wait a second.
That's possible?

913
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:13,484
Nothing in life ever
stays the same,

914
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,611
good or bad.

915
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:17,321
Just remember--

916
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:21,283
when the clock
strikes midnight, run.

917
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:28,540
Hyah!

918
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:07,121
-

919
00:54:07,204 --> 00:54:09,331
Are we really gonna
stay up here the whole night

920
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:11,583
like lifeless bunting?

921
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:13,544
You know how much
I love to dance.

922
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,754
Tonight is not about you.
It's about me.

923
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,925
And keeping an eye on our son.

924
00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:22,845
Whether he shows up or not
remains to be seen.

925
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:28,392
Would this be a good time
for me to bring up

926
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,060
my comprehensive plan
to reduce poverty

927
00:54:30,144 --> 00:54:31,812
-in the urban row housing?
-No, darling.

928
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:33,731
-Read the room.
-Never.

929
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:41,572
Ladies and gentlemen,
your prince!

930
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:06,764
-

931
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:17,941
what a man, what a man

932
00:55:21,028 --> 00:55:23,030
what a man, what a man

933
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:26,116
mighty good man

934
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,619
what a man, what a man

935
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:33,916
what a man, what a man

936
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,584
-

937
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,336
a minute or two

938
00:55:38,879 --> 00:55:40,881
a difference in my world

939
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:42,591
most men are hos

940
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:46,095
with another girl

941
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:48,680
because it's just pathetic

942
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:51,892
that "he said, she said" crowd

943
00:55:51,975 --> 00:55:53,852
ain't nobody perfect

944
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:55,437
to those who deserve it

945
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:57,356
he's worth it

946
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,066
-

947
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,567
the past

948
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:02,653
that can make me laugh

949
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,117
have your baby

950
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,160
What a man,
what a man, what a man

951
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:11,662
-

952
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:15,374
what a man, what a man

953
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,377
mighty good man

954
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,962
what a man, what a man

955
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:22,089
-

956
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,801
what a man, what a man

957
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:43,068
couldn't hold me back

958
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:49,992
right behind my back

959
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:53,495
to myself at night

960
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:01,336
through my mind

961
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,179
my eyes says leave it alone

962
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:27,070
coming back my way

963
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:31,074
-

964
00:57:31,158 --> 00:57:32,910
What a man,
what a mighty good man

965
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:34,620
-

966
00:57:34,703 --> 00:57:36,788
What a man,
what a mighty good man

967
00:57:36,872 --> 00:57:38,749
what you want to hear

968
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,294
-

969
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:44,463
What a man,
what a mighty good man

970
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:46,215
What
a man, what a man, what a man

971
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:47,925
mighty, mighty good man

972
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:49,843
-

973
00:57:49,927 --> 00:57:51,553
-

974
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:53,180
-

975
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:03,398
-

976
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:23,752
HENCH:
Did you see me?

977
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,170
I lifted her up!

978
00:58:25,254 --> 00:58:27,547
GRIFF:
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know!

979
00:58:29,633 --> 00:58:31,426
Where is she?

980
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,018
I'm so sorry.

981
00:58:40,102 --> 00:58:41,228
I don't know
what I was thinking.

982
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:42,729
No, please, forgive me.

983
00:58:42,813 --> 00:58:45,440
I'm not accustomed to being
among nobility, Your Grace.

984
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,235
Think nothing of it.

985
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,738
Tonight, we are all equals
in the eye of the king.

986
00:58:51,822 --> 00:58:53,824
You're too kind.

987
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:56,910
My, what lovely shoes.

988
00:58:56,994 --> 00:58:59,371
They're glass.

989
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:01,999
-I could walk in them
easily after, like, four steps.

990
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,336
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me,

991
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,715
I was making my way
up to the balcony.

992
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:12,676
Because the best view
is always from on high.

993
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:17,180
Oh, my God.

994
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:20,142
Look at us. We're standing
outside the palace.

995
00:59:20,225 --> 00:59:22,477
W-We're-we're literally
breathing the same air

996
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:24,062
as the royal family.

997
00:59:24,146 --> 00:59:26,106
Whatever happens after tonight,
I'm a changed mouse.

998
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:27,316
-Mm-hmm.
-JAMES: Guys!

999
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:29,192
I just relieved myself,

1000
00:59:29,276 --> 00:59:31,403
and you are not gonna believe
how it happens.

1001
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:32,696
Through your front tail.
We know.

1002
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:34,197
-Yes!
-Unbelievable, isn't it?

1003
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,741
-Incredible, right? -It's
like...

1004
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:36,992
You're-you're making me
want to go again right now.

1005
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:38,327
JAMES:
You should go. Go now.

1006
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,453
I would. Not got the urge.

1007
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:41,747
I mean, could tonight
be any better?!

1008
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,792
TATIANA:
Excuse me, my dear.

1009
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:47,502
May I ask you a question?

1010
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:49,129
-Yes, Your Highness.
-

1011
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:51,465
"Your Highness" was the man
whose blood I spilled

1012
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:52,716
to take this crown.

1013
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,718
-Ooh.
-Call me Tatiana.

1014
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:57,262
-Queen Tatiana.
-Of course.

1015
00:59:57,346 --> 00:59:58,430
Queen Tatiana.

1016
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,182
Where did you get that dress?

1017
01:00:00,265 --> 01:00:02,809
It's so structured and yet

1018
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:05,896
so delicate and-and...
and beautiful.

1019
01:00:05,979 --> 01:00:07,773
Me-me did. I--

1020
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:09,358
It's-it's what I,
what-what I, what I done.

1021
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:11,902
What I, what I hope--
 I-I do--

1022
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:13,945
I was-- I-I did it.

1023
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:16,656
I cou-- I want to. I...

1024
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,077
ROBERT:
Good evening, ladies.

1025
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,787
First, I would like to thank
each and every one of you

1026
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:22,829
for being here.

1027
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:25,540
You are all so beautiful

1028
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:27,542
and have so much to offer.

1029
01:00:27,626 --> 01:00:29,920
But if I'm being honest,

1030
01:00:30,003 --> 01:00:32,506
there is only one
who has captured my attention.

1031
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:34,216
-Sadly, I have not

1032
01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:35,509
cast my eyes on her tonight.

1033
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:38,136
-

1034
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:43,266
Sorry. Words. Um...
-

1035
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,726
I designed it.

1036
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,270
Then I am honored
to be in the presence

1037
01:00:47,354 --> 01:00:48,939
of such an artist.

1038
01:00:49,022 --> 01:00:51,691
Would it be possible
to see more of your work?

1039
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:54,444
-More than possible.
-Good.

1040
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:56,947
I attend lavish events
around the world,

1041
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,698
and I hate all my clothes.

1042
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:02,285
I'm looking for someone
to travel with me

1043
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,704
to enliven my wardrobe.

1044
01:01:04,788 --> 01:01:06,289
Maybe that person is you.

1045
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:08,667
Me?

1046
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,378
We will meet tomorrow
when the clock strikes 4:00.

1047
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:13,255
I have an hour
before I catch my ship home.

1048
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:15,966
Yes, yes. I'll be at the
south end of the market square.

1049
01:01:16,049 --> 01:01:18,468
Don't be late.
It's unlikely I'll return here,

1050
01:01:18,552 --> 01:01:21,263
and I have no patience
for those who misuse my time.

1051
01:01:21,346 --> 01:01:22,889
-Of course.
-After all,

1052
01:01:22,973 --> 01:01:25,934
I am a frickin' queen.

1053
01:01:29,396 --> 01:01:31,148
This is why
you save caterpillars.

1054
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:32,983
ROBERT:
A-And then she suggested

1055
01:01:33,066 --> 01:01:34,734
that I was a mama's boy
who still gets

1056
01:01:34,818 --> 01:01:36,445
a little spanking
on the tush-tush.

1057
01:01:36,528 --> 01:01:37,946
-What?

1058
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:39,406
ROBERT:
Oh, now, now.

1059
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:41,241
Don't act like you haven't
heard the rumors yourselves.

1060
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:44,327
Look, I'm not ashamed
to admit that my mother

1061
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:46,663
is a wonderful, strong woman.

1062
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,791
We get along very well.

1063
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:52,210
-But not that well.
-

1064
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:53,503
My father, on the other hand,

1065
01:01:53,587 --> 01:01:55,172
well, he-he's not exactly
getting any younger.

1066
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:57,924
-Oh! -Oh!
-

1067
01:01:58,008 --> 01:01:59,050
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:06,183
Oh, my God.

1069
01:02:06,266 --> 01:02:08,143
That didn't happen.
Didn't happen.

1070
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:09,936
And even if it did happen,
I'm magic,

1071
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,646
-so nobody can see me.
-Hi.

1072
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:14,107
-You look, you look
so different. -Me different?

1073
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:16,193
You're the one
who looks different!

1074
01:02:16,276 --> 01:02:17,861
All clean and...

1075
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:19,905
-That's a nice jacket.
-

1076
01:02:19,988 --> 01:02:21,823
Why would you let me speak
so poorly of you to your face?

1077
01:02:21,907 --> 01:02:24,409
-I admit it was deceitful,
but... -

1078
01:02:24,493 --> 01:02:26,578
I mean, it worked. Here you are.

1079
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:28,455
Yes, and I am leaving.

1080
01:02:28,538 --> 01:02:31,333
I've seen the dresses,
I drank the bubble drink,

1081
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,418
and now I actually have a chance
to make my dreams come true.

1082
01:02:33,502 --> 01:02:35,045
So I'm gonna go.

1083
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:36,671
I'm gonna go
while I'm still ahead.

1084
01:02:36,755 --> 01:02:37,881
Thank you.

1085
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,633
Well, you haven't seen
all of the dresses.

1086
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:55,815
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd be remiss if I didn't take

1087
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:58,109
a moment to acknowledge
someone truly special.

1088
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,405
The people's princess,

1089
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:04,115
my little sister.

1090
01:03:05,242 --> 01:03:06,243
Gwendolyn.

1091
01:03:19,256 --> 01:03:20,799
CINDERELLA:
That's my dress.

1092
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:23,343
That's-that's my dress
on the princess.

1093
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:25,345
-Are you all right?
-

1094
01:03:25,428 --> 01:03:27,639
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just, uh...

1095
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:30,141
I need you to stop the room
from spinning.

1096
01:03:30,225 --> 01:03:32,227
Perhaps this will work.

1097
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:35,939
M-Maybe would you like to dance?

1098
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:37,732
Right now?

1099
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:28,867
the someone waiting for me

1100
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:57,228
-

1101
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:22,921
our favorite song

1102
01:05:58,415 --> 01:06:01,626
our favorite song

1103
01:06:05,255 --> 01:06:11,886
an angel in person

1104
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:19,644
-

1105
01:06:19,728 --> 01:06:23,565
-

1106
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:29,195
-

1107
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:40,582
Would you care to talk
alone somewhere?

1108
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:42,292
Lead the way.

1109
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:50,884
-What's it like being a crate?

1110
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:52,677
Like, this has got to be
a step up, right?

1111
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:54,888
-ROBERT: So this is
the fountain. -CINDERELLA: Ooh.

1112
01:06:54,971 --> 01:06:56,681
ROBERT: Do you have
a fountain where you live?

1113
01:06:56,765 --> 01:06:57,891
CINDERELLA:
Um, I don't.

1114
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:00,602
I just have
streaming water sometimes.

1115
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:03,271
-What is that? What is that?
-Did you hear that? That.

1116
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:07,233
-What?!
-This is bloody brilliant.

1117
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:08,943
What even is that?

1118
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:12,447
-We're just banging 'em
together. -I know.

1119
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,741
Humans can be so loud.

1120
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:24,584
-CINDERELLA: You make me
nervous. -ROBERT: Aw.

1121
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:28,338
Everything about tonight
is insane, right?

1122
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:30,965
B-Blink once
if you can understand me.

1123
01:07:32,175 --> 01:07:33,343
-

1124
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:34,636
-ROBERT: You all right?
-CINDERELLA: Yeah.

1125
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,262
-Thanks for the jacket.
-ROBERT: Yeah.

1126
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:38,264
No, it's not like
I'm cold or anything.

1127
01:07:41,226 --> 01:07:43,269
-Here we are.
-Wow.

1128
01:07:44,687 --> 01:07:47,106
It's beautiful.

1129
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:49,692
Oh, um, I should probably
take my shoes off.

1130
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:50,777
-Right?
-Oh, no, you're fine.

1131
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,446
This floor is literally
2,000 years old.

1132
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,866
-So no?
-You're fine.

1133
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,244
-Okay.
-

1134
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:05,750
Are you gonna play something
on the piano just for me?

1135
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:09,420
Oh, my God, you are.

1136
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:39,993
Wow.

1137
01:08:40,076 --> 01:08:43,204
You're so full
of hidden talents.

1138
01:08:43,288 --> 01:08:45,415
So it sounds like you might
disagree with those who say

1139
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:48,084
I "serve no real purpose
other than to wreck things"?

1140
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:50,420
Just so you know,

1141
01:08:50,503 --> 01:08:52,088
I don't actually think
those things about you.

1142
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,339
Especially now.

1143
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:55,675
Well, you should.

1144
01:08:56,718 --> 01:08:57,886
Wh-Why?

1145
01:08:57,969 --> 01:09:01,264
I mean, you're in line
to be our future king.

1146
01:09:01,347 --> 01:09:03,141
Oh, it's a bad system.

1147
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:04,142
My only qualification being

1148
01:09:04,225 --> 01:09:06,895
-that my dad was one.
-Mm.

1149
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:11,858
It's not that
I don't want to be king.

1150
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:15,236
When I was little,
I remember watching my father

1151
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,823
go off to war
and thinking how...

1152
01:09:18,907 --> 01:09:21,117
brave he looked in his armor.

1153
01:09:22,535 --> 01:09:25,371
And I wanted to be
just like him.

1154
01:09:25,455 --> 01:09:30,293
And then, as I got older
and my life became

1155
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:33,212
more about
traditions and customs

1156
01:09:33,296 --> 01:09:38,134
and people always watching me
and telling me what to do...

1157
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:45,433
...and never asking
what I want or how I feel...

1158
01:09:46,476 --> 01:09:48,436
I know exactly what you mean.

1159
01:09:53,316 --> 01:09:54,442
What?

1160
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:56,319
I just had...

1161
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:58,696
no idea
tonight would go like this.

1162
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:02,492
This is precisely
how I hoped tonight would go.

1163
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:05,578
You're the one.

1164
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,165
I pick you to be my princess.

1165
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,418
What's wrong?

1166
01:10:12,502 --> 01:10:14,170
I-I assure you
it doesn't matter to me

1167
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:15,380
that you're not of royal birth.

1168
01:10:15,463 --> 01:10:16,589
No, that's not it.

1169
01:10:16,673 --> 01:10:18,174
W-We'll get married.

1170
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:19,634
Okay? We'll-we'll get married

1171
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:21,594
and you will live the rest
of your life as royalty.

1172
01:10:21,678 --> 01:10:23,972
Royalty? What about my work?

1173
01:10:24,055 --> 01:10:25,139
M-My dresses can...

1174
01:10:25,223 --> 01:10:27,642
Well, that would
most likely be frowned upon.

1175
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:29,686
Women have
a very prescribed role in court.

1176
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:31,688
-"Prescribed role in court"?
-But I would make sure

1177
01:10:31,771 --> 01:10:33,398
that you were dressed by
the finest dressmakers

1178
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:35,191
-in all the land.
-I'm a dressmaker.

1179
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:37,193
I know. There's just
no one else in this world

1180
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:38,486
I'd rather be with than you.

1181
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:39,904
Robert, stop.

1182
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,449
I don't want a life stuck
waving from a royal box

1183
01:10:43,533 --> 01:10:45,910
any more than a life
confined to a basement.

1184
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:49,414
I have dreams
that I have to chase.

1185
01:10:51,124 --> 01:10:53,376
So if it's a choice...

1186
01:10:56,504 --> 01:10:58,131
...I choose me.

1187
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:06,556
I understand.

1188
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:14,063
Really, I... I do.

1189
01:12:21,089 --> 01:12:23,091
I'm sorry.

1190
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:36,354
What time is it?

1191
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,980
It's midnight.

1192
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:40,191
I have to go.

1193
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:41,400
Wait!

1194
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:44,278
-I don't like this.

1195
01:12:44,362 --> 01:12:46,739
-Some-Something's changed.
-Relax. We are fine.

1196
01:12:46,823 --> 01:12:48,074
JOHN:
 Ah!

1197
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:49,200
You just cleaned
phantom whiskers.

1198
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:51,119
-No, I did not.
-You did, too.

1199
01:12:51,202 --> 01:12:54,163
-

1200
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:56,040
TATIANA:
Where are you off to, my dear?

1201
01:12:56,124 --> 01:12:58,334
Am I to assume
I've lost you to the prince?

1202
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,962
No, my queen. I'll meet you
tomorrow, I promise.

1203
01:13:01,796 --> 01:13:03,631
What's happening?

1204
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:05,842
My good people,
your future queen.

1205
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:08,427
-

1206
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:18,479
Help.

1207
01:13:18,563 --> 01:13:20,064
This way. This way.

1208
01:13:21,274 --> 01:13:22,692
Wilbur.

1209
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:23,943
Mm.

1210
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:26,237
You go.
I'll take care of this.

1211
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,406
Thank you so much.
I'll never forget this.

1212
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:30,158
Neither will I.

1213
01:13:31,826 --> 01:13:33,828
The magic's wearing off.

1214
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:35,997
-What are we gonna do?
-What did the butterfly say?

1215
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,249
He called us disgusting,
that jerk.

1216
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:39,834
About the magic.
What was said about the magic?

1217
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:42,128
I don't know.
I was singing.

1218
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:44,297
-Why didn't you pay attention?
-Because I was singing!

1219
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,882
-
continues indistinctly)

1220
01:13:50,303 --> 01:13:51,929
Dress your feet for comfort!

1221
01:13:52,847 --> 01:13:54,390
-Get in.
-

1222
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,350
-Halt, I say!
-

1223
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:02,440
JAMES:
Come on, quick!

1224
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,776
-Get in! Quickly! Hurry!
-JOHN: Come on!

1225
01:14:14,702 --> 01:14:17,079
Look. She threw
a glass shoe at me.

1226
01:14:19,999 --> 01:14:22,293
I-I feel all tingly.

1227
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:23,961
Like I'm gonna...

1228
01:14:25,963 --> 01:14:27,548
Now I'm feeling tingly.

1229
01:14:27,632 --> 01:14:29,425
I don't want to go...

1230
01:14:32,678 --> 01:14:35,306
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

1231
01:14:37,892 --> 01:14:39,810
ROMESH: I'm starting
to feel a bit funny.

1232
01:14:39,894 --> 01:14:41,312
I feel tingly!

1233
01:14:41,395 --> 01:14:42,647
-CINDERELLA: No!

1234
01:14:52,323 --> 01:14:53,991
No!

1235
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:11,175
Are we going down?

1236
01:15:11,259 --> 01:15:12,301
-We're going down.
-

1237
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:13,678
Just be quiet as a mouse.

1238
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:19,976
Hmm.

1239
01:15:20,059 --> 01:15:21,310
JAMES:
Maybe we're not going...

1240
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,381
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1241
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:53,718
All the townspeople's
tax dollars

1242
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,137
wasted on a ball, and for what?

1243
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,098
For you to make
a complete fool out of me?

1244
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,850
To teach me a lesson?

1245
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:02,268
I'm sorry, Father.

1246
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,979
You are single-handedly
destroying my legacy.

1247
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:08,065
I know you might not
understand this,

1248
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:10,359
but the woman I chose
didn't choose me.

1249
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:12,320
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

1250
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:15,823
Aw.

1251
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:17,491
Have you lost your mind?!

1252
01:16:17,575 --> 01:16:19,869
You are the future king,

1253
01:16:19,952 --> 01:16:24,123
and as king, it is all about you
and your power.

1254
01:16:24,206 --> 01:16:26,167
There are no other opinions.
None.

1255
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:32,757
Is this a good time to ask

1256
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,550
why we are spending money
on catapults

1257
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:36,552
-when we have so many already?
-

1258
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,679
It really just benefits
the catapult makers.

1259
01:16:38,763 --> 01:16:40,639
Quiet, Gwen!

1260
01:16:40,723 --> 01:16:42,516
I really think we just need
to get some sleep.

1261
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,143
No one asked you, Beatrice.

1262
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:55,154
Your time is up, Robert.

1263
01:16:56,947 --> 01:17:00,242
You will marry Princess Laura
by week's end.

1264
01:17:00,326 --> 01:17:02,661
I don't care
if you don't love each other.

1265
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:05,831
So says the king.

1266
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:15,925
If the crown demands it...

1267
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:17,843
milord.

1268
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:24,058
Darling.

1269
01:17:32,525 --> 01:17:33,943
What?

1270
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:36,570
Did you really just say
you don't care

1271
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:37,988
if they love each other?

1272
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:40,699
Yeah. I want the sea monster.

1273
01:17:40,783 --> 01:17:42,618
What? Bea-Bea-Beatrice,
don't be...

1274
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,537
Ay... ay, ay, ay.

1275
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,955
-Your Highness.
-Yes?

1276
01:17:46,038 --> 01:17:47,832
-Where'd you find that?
-It's the girl's.

1277
01:17:47,915 --> 01:17:51,168
She threw it at my head.
I'm lucky to be alive.

1278
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:04,098
Look at our girl.

1279
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:05,891
Been up all night working.

1280
01:18:05,975 --> 01:18:08,185
-She's betting on herself.
-JAMES: I couldn't do it.

1281
01:18:08,269 --> 01:18:09,728
I would've married the prince.

1282
01:18:09,812 --> 01:18:12,106
You think the prince
would've picked you?

1283
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:14,567
Cuddly, cute, good at waving.

1284
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,818
I mean, come on.

1285
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:19,447
I can hear you.

1286
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,031
I bet you're arguing about why

1287
01:18:21,115 --> 01:18:23,784
I didn't just say yes
to marrying Robert.

1288
01:18:23,868 --> 01:18:26,829
Especially since I'm maybe
in love with him.

1289
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,539
JOHN:
Love? It was one night.

1290
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,915
-

1291
01:18:29,999 --> 01:18:32,251
I never felt what I felt
last night before.

1292
01:18:33,878 --> 01:18:36,338
I mean, you guys,
he's so handsome.

1293
01:18:36,422 --> 01:18:37,840
-Oh, yes, he is incredibly
handsome. -Absolutely.

1294
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:39,550
-Annoyingly handsome.
-The cheekbones.

1295
01:18:39,633 --> 01:18:40,801
And he likes me for me.

1296
01:18:40,885 --> 01:18:42,344
Sounds like true love
to this mouse.

1297
01:18:42,428 --> 01:18:44,138
You're right, my friend.

1298
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:47,141
But if saying yes to him

1299
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:50,060
means saying no to this...

1300
01:18:51,145 --> 01:18:53,772
...I can't do it.

1301
01:18:53,856 --> 01:18:55,691
All right, guys?

1302
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:59,487
I have to try and make a life
for myself, by myself.

1303
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:01,989
Because that is what I want.

1304
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:04,241
And Queen Tatiana is my chance.

1305
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:05,576
Right.

1306
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:07,036
-Who's Queen Tatiana?
-

1307
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:08,329
VIVIAN:
Cinderella, are you down there?

1308
01:19:08,412 --> 01:19:09,622
-Stepmother?
-Dear God, no.

1309
01:19:09,705 --> 01:19:11,540
-She scares me.
-Me, too.

1310
01:19:11,624 --> 01:19:15,127
-Hello.
I'm waiting for my tea.

1311
01:19:15,211 --> 01:19:17,630
Cinderella.
Oh, I'm coming down.

1312
01:19:25,471 --> 01:19:26,764
I'm sick.

1313
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,642
Uh-huh.

1314
01:19:36,774 --> 01:19:38,943
Well, you didn't miss much
at the ball.

1315
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:45,032
The prince was fixated
on some mystery girl.

1316
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:49,328
Then she ran away like a twit.

1317
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:52,790
So now he's to marry
Princess Laura of Northphalia

1318
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:54,416
the day after next.

1319
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,586
Malvolia and Narissa,
they never stood a chance.

1320
01:19:58,629 --> 01:20:01,173
And I was so foolish
to believe differently.

1321
01:20:02,466 --> 01:20:05,010
A mother just gets carried away.

1322
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:09,598
I know I've been hard on you.

1323
01:20:10,975 --> 01:20:12,810
It's not fueled by spite.

1324
01:20:24,196 --> 01:20:27,116
I've never shared this
with anyone before, but...

1325
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:32,162
I used to play piano.

1326
01:20:32,246 --> 01:20:34,290
Taught myself.

1327
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,669
And I was good.

1328
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:41,797
I was really good.

1329
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:45,759
Nothing made me happier.

1330
01:20:47,595 --> 01:20:50,639
Then one day,
I was given the opportunity

1331
01:20:50,723 --> 01:20:53,767
to train at the finest
school of music,

1332
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:56,395
and I took it.

1333
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:58,397
There I was--

1334
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,358
two children, a loving husband,

1335
01:21:01,442 --> 01:21:04,987
and I had the audacity
to want more.

1336
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:11,076
It was just a month-- one month.

1337
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,414
And yet, when I returned,
my husband, well...

1338
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:20,252
...he believed real wives
didn't act so frivolously.

1339
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:29,553
You may think me cruel.

1340
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:40,522
But the real cruelty would be
for me to allow you to think

1341
01:21:40,606 --> 01:21:42,358
that you can be
something you can't.

1342
01:21:57,915 --> 01:21:59,333
This shoe.

1343
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,382
It was you.

1344
01:22:06,465 --> 01:22:07,925
Cinderella.

1345
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:10,636
I don't know how you did
what you did last night,

1346
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,763
but the prince chose you.
He loves you.

1347
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:14,973
Marry him, and all of
our problems will be solved.

1348
01:22:15,057 --> 01:22:17,476
I can't. I told him
I didn't want to marry him.

1349
01:22:17,559 --> 01:22:18,811
Tell him you were wrong.

1350
01:22:18,894 --> 01:22:20,646
Tell him... tell him
it's all you want.

1351
01:22:20,729 --> 01:22:22,648
If not for yourself,
then-then do it for us.

1352
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:23,899
For your family.

1353
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,526
I can help our family,
Stepmother.

1354
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:26,652
I can provide for us.

1355
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:27,778
Don't be so stupid.

1356
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:29,321
Who taught you
to think that way?

1357
01:22:29,405 --> 01:22:31,490
Please, Cinderella, don't
throw away this opportunity.

1358
01:22:31,573 --> 01:22:32,783
Go back to him.

1359
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:35,869
It's too late.

1360
01:22:35,953 --> 01:22:37,871
He's marrying someone else.

1361
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:39,581
It's over.

1362
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:47,089
Fine.

1363
01:22:51,677 --> 01:22:53,846
Then I'm taking you to Thomas,

1364
01:22:53,929 --> 01:22:56,640
and I'm giving you to him today.

1365
01:22:57,725 --> 01:22:59,935
I would rather die.

1366
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:29,173
bury it

1367
01:23:31,884 --> 01:23:35,095
carry it

1368
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:38,682
to your grave, oh

1369
01:24:05,292 --> 01:24:09,755
of letting you fly

1370
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:15,511
in the wrong time

1371
01:24:15,594 --> 01:24:18,055
-

1372
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:21,058
-

1373
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:24,144
-

1374
01:24:37,658 --> 01:24:39,868
-

1375
01:24:39,952 --> 01:24:43,121
-

1376
01:24:43,205 --> 01:24:44,665
-

1377
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:46,333
-

1378
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:49,211
-

1379
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:52,381
-

1380
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:55,384
-

1381
01:24:55,467 --> 01:24:56,760
-

1382
01:24:56,844 --> 01:24:59,054
-

1383
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:01,640
-

1384
01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:04,726
Bury it, marry it,
carry it, carry it

1385
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:10,167
Leave us.

1386
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:20,510
You haven't spoken to me
since last night.

1387
01:26:23,055 --> 01:26:24,640
You're mad
because I yelled at you.

1388
01:26:26,475 --> 01:26:29,186
I hate to break it to you,
but kings yell.

1389
01:26:30,896 --> 01:26:33,398
Please, say something.

1390
01:26:33,482 --> 01:26:35,692
You're making me
wildly uncomfortable.

1391
01:26:38,654 --> 01:26:40,530
Have you ever wondered
why Robert makes

1392
01:26:40,614 --> 01:26:42,491
the process to marry
so difficult?

1393
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:46,161
Because he's a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up. Simple.

1394
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:49,790
I believe it's because of the
example set before him by us.

1395
01:26:49,873 --> 01:26:52,250
A marriage without love,
without respect.

1396
01:26:52,334 --> 01:26:54,002
Bea, please,
you know I love you.

1397
01:26:54,086 --> 01:26:55,754
Saying "love" and showing love

1398
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,423
are two very different things,
Rowan.

1399
01:26:58,507 --> 01:27:01,885
Before you were king,
I felt your love every day.

1400
01:27:01,969 --> 01:27:04,513
You couldn't stand to be away
from me, even for a moment.

1401
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:07,015
Remember, you used to appear
at my window

1402
01:27:07,099 --> 01:27:09,017
like a knight in shining armor

1403
01:27:09,101 --> 01:27:12,521
and you'd serenade me
with your skull-splitting voice.

1404
01:27:12,604 --> 01:27:14,189
We were young.

1405
01:27:14,272 --> 01:27:17,109
Things... change.

1406
01:27:17,192 --> 01:27:19,027
No. You changed.

1407
01:27:19,111 --> 01:27:20,654
The crown changed you.

1408
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:23,532
You're so worried
to look a fool.

1409
01:27:23,615 --> 01:27:26,868
So obsessed with your
reputation, with your legacy.

1410
01:27:26,952 --> 01:27:28,954
Well, it's only my life's work.

1411
01:27:29,037 --> 01:27:31,206
It causes me
a great deal of stress.

1412
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:33,291
Do you think you're the only
person who feels stress?

1413
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:35,794
God, try being your bloody wife.

1414
01:27:35,877 --> 01:27:39,464
It is utterly exhausting to sit
next to you and just smile

1415
01:27:39,548 --> 01:27:41,466
as if I were nothing more
than a prop,

1416
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,302
my voice completely silenced.

1417
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:46,471
I mean, what I wouldn't give
to say, "You're wrong,"

1418
01:27:46,555 --> 01:27:48,432
in front of the entire kingdom.

1419
01:27:48,515 --> 01:27:50,017
Bea...

1420
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,144
you're being unreasonable now.

1421
01:27:53,937 --> 01:27:56,064
Well, if you say so.

1422
01:27:56,148 --> 01:27:58,150
After all, you're the king.

1423
01:28:00,152 --> 01:28:02,529
Can't be any other opinions
other than yours.

1424
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:10,454
Do you know,
there's never a guarantee

1425
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:13,457
with a couple in our position.

1426
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,709
But we had love, Rowan.

1427
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,878
We had it.

1428
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:19,588
And now...

1429
01:28:22,007 --> 01:28:24,217
Robert's wiser than both of us.

1430
01:28:31,892 --> 01:28:33,518
Hello.

1431
01:28:36,438 --> 01:28:38,065
I'm ready.

1432
01:28:46,323 --> 01:28:48,742
You summoned me, Your Highness?

1433
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,954
We can't have
a regular conversation

1434
01:28:53,038 --> 01:28:54,873
like a normal father and son,
can we?

1435
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:56,666
No, no.

1436
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,627
To satisfy your power trip,
you have to sit there

1437
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,629
on your slightly too tall
throne.

1438
01:29:00,712 --> 01:29:02,089
You-you belittle me in your...

1439
01:29:02,172 --> 01:29:05,467
your-your king voice, yes.

1440
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,803
All because you're so insecure

1441
01:29:07,886 --> 01:29:10,388
with your legacy that you
have to control my every move.

1442
01:29:10,472 --> 01:29:12,057
Now, I ask you,

1443
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,309
does that sound
like a strong leader to you?

1444
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,769
ROWAN:
Robert...

1445
01:29:17,437 --> 01:29:19,397
I was wrong.

1446
01:29:27,614 --> 01:29:31,034
I, King Rowan...

1447
01:29:32,327 --> 01:29:33,995
Am I doing the king voice?

1448
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:35,664
A little bit.
You can't help yourself.

1449
01:29:43,672 --> 01:29:46,007
Go find the owner
of this glass slipper.

1450
01:29:46,091 --> 01:29:50,220
And if she'll take you back,
then marry her.

1451
01:29:50,303 --> 01:29:51,930
Or don't.

1452
01:29:53,473 --> 01:29:55,016
It's your life, son.

1453
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,643
Wh-Why the sudden
change of heart?

1454
01:29:56,726 --> 01:29:59,771
Well, definitely
wasn't your mum.

1455
01:30:00,939 --> 01:30:02,858
-Go on, leave now.
-

1456
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:04,651
Be bold.

1457
01:30:13,368 --> 01:30:15,162
you won't believe

1458
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:18,373
at the ball

1459
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:20,959
for a pretty young lady

1460
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:23,086
who then turned out to be

1461
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:25,005
see, at the end of the night

1462
01:30:25,088 --> 01:30:27,632
she left no name

1463
01:30:27,716 --> 01:30:29,176
just a shoe made of glass

1464
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:30,969
for the girl

1465
01:30:31,052 --> 01:30:33,430
no buckles, no laces

1466
01:30:33,513 --> 01:30:35,307
-ROSEMARY:

1467
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,309
does it look like this?

1468
01:30:37,392 --> 01:30:39,227
swing and a miss

1469
01:30:39,311 --> 01:30:41,897
could my foot be right?

1470
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:44,774
a canoe, ma'am, way too tight

1471
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:46,902
that I birthed

1472
01:30:56,578 --> 01:30:57,746
-Mm.
-

1473
01:30:57,829 --> 01:30:59,289
That is too bad.

1474
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:01,249
But I like those vocal runs.

1475
01:31:03,418 --> 01:31:06,213
who needs convincing

1476
01:31:06,296 --> 01:31:08,548
with the ring-a-ding-ding

1477
01:31:08,632 --> 01:31:11,343
in the shoe that goes bling

1478
01:31:11,426 --> 01:31:14,262
tell it to your future king.

1479
01:31:18,099 --> 01:31:19,142
Not her.

1480
01:31:24,814 --> 01:31:25,815
Worth a try.

1481
01:31:29,194 --> 01:31:30,445
No.

1482
01:31:36,743 --> 01:31:38,745
I mean, don't they know
I'm looking for her?

1483
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:42,707
No.

1484
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:43,833
Nope, not her.

1485
01:31:45,168 --> 01:31:46,253
Nope.

1486
01:31:49,923 --> 01:31:51,383
Nope. No. No.

1487
01:31:57,472 --> 01:31:59,307
Not interested.

1488
01:32:01,017 --> 01:32:02,769
I mean, me, neither.

1489
01:32:02,852 --> 01:32:04,729
You don't say.

1490
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:08,692
We're not going to find her.

1491
01:32:08,775 --> 01:32:10,694
-We should just go home.
-I can't.

1492
01:32:10,777 --> 01:32:13,154
I have to let her know
that it's possible between us.

1493
01:32:13,238 --> 01:32:16,616
It's a beautiful thing
how much you love her.

1494
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,953
-You crying, Hench?
-So what if I am?

1495
01:32:20,036 --> 01:32:22,163
Would that we all have
what Robert has.

1496
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:25,208
I mean, what is life

1497
01:32:25,292 --> 01:32:27,294
if you're not with
the person you love?

1498
01:32:27,377 --> 01:32:29,004
Right?

1499
01:32:29,087 --> 01:32:31,798
Otherwise, we might as well
just close our eyes

1500
01:32:31,881 --> 01:32:36,803
and take the ol' mud nap,
because...

1501
01:32:36,886 --> 01:32:39,264
nothing else matters.

1502
01:32:41,057 --> 01:32:43,143
So we find her, then.

1503
01:32:43,226 --> 01:32:44,728
Robert, where did you see her

1504
01:32:44,811 --> 01:32:46,354
the last time
you went searching?

1505
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:51,026
I am the king's idiot son.

1506
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:52,485
-Hyah!
-

1507
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,840
VIVIAN: Cinderella's been
working on her recipes for you.

1508
01:33:13,923 --> 01:33:15,967
THOMAS:
Well, I should hope so.

1509
01:33:24,851 --> 01:33:25,810
Two, three.

1510
01:33:25,894 --> 01:33:28,063
ALL:
For Ella...!

1511
01:33:30,607 --> 01:33:33,026
Remember me as a hero!

1512
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:35,236
-

1513
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:03,181
a shot in the dark

1514
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,058
pride and shame

1515
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:06,893
CINDERELLA:

1516
01:34:06,976 --> 01:34:09,145
-

1517
01:34:09,229 --> 01:34:11,689
-

1518
01:34:11,773 --> 01:34:13,400
ROBERT:

1519
01:34:15,318 --> 01:34:17,570
as an untold story

1520
01:34:17,654 --> 01:34:19,197
CINDERELLA:

1521
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,742
-

1522
01:34:22,826 --> 01:34:25,703
in a blaze of glory

1523
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:32,085
-

1524
01:34:34,129 --> 01:34:35,922
You all right?

1525
01:34:38,258 --> 01:34:40,468
-What are you doing here?
-Are you hurt?

1526
01:34:40,552 --> 01:34:42,262
No, I-I'm fine.
I just really have to...

1527
01:34:42,345 --> 01:34:43,638
Good. I've been looking for you.

1528
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:45,014
Why?

1529
01:34:45,098 --> 01:34:46,891
I have something
that I want to say.

1530
01:34:46,975 --> 01:34:48,393
You inspired me.

1531
01:34:48,476 --> 01:34:49,936
Me?

1532
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:51,813
It never occurred to me
that I could choose

1533
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:53,523
the course of my own life.

1534
01:34:53,606 --> 01:34:56,609
See, I-I always felt
that it was written for me.

1535
01:34:56,693 --> 01:34:59,821
But watching you, I-I realized
that anything is possible.

1536
01:34:59,904 --> 01:35:01,698
That's so sweet.

1537
01:35:01,781 --> 01:35:03,950
I'm just really in a hurry.
If we could talk about it...

1538
01:35:04,033 --> 01:35:06,744
I realize now that I can have
a life that is all mine.

1539
01:35:06,828 --> 01:35:08,872
Great. This is gonna
be a lengthy discussion.

1540
01:35:08,955 --> 01:35:12,292
What I'm trying to say
is that I choose me.

1541
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:13,751
Hmm?

1542
01:35:13,835 --> 01:35:16,838
God, this is not coming out
how I wanted it to.

1543
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:20,508
I don't have to be king.

1544
01:35:20,592 --> 01:35:22,135
It is not what I want anymore.

1545
01:35:22,218 --> 01:35:23,470
You are.

1546
01:35:23,553 --> 01:35:26,264
So, what I'm saying is

1547
01:35:26,347 --> 01:35:28,766
choosing me is choosing us.

1548
01:35:30,393 --> 01:35:32,979
That is, as long as
you feel the same way.

1549
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:37,817
Your silence is...

1550
01:35:55,585 --> 01:35:57,504
That was the most romantic
moment of my life.

1551
01:35:57,587 --> 01:35:58,671
Same.

1552
01:35:58,755 --> 01:36:00,965
-I mean, you rode up on a horse.
-I did.

1553
01:36:01,049 --> 01:36:02,008
It was really cool.

1554
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:03,635
You look so beautiful.

1555
01:36:03,718 --> 01:36:05,220
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you.

1556
01:36:05,303 --> 01:36:07,305
Oh, uh, got to go.
I need you to

1557
01:36:07,388 --> 01:36:09,682
put me on that horse and get me
to the market square, please.

1558
01:36:09,766 --> 01:36:11,184
-Okay.
-What? No.

1559
01:36:11,267 --> 01:36:12,810
-No? Okay. I'm sorry. Yes.
-I can walk. It's-it's faster.

1560
01:36:12,894 --> 01:36:14,062
But thank you.
That's really nice.

1561
01:36:16,606 --> 01:36:19,359
-ROWAN Beatrice!

1562
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:22,403
Beatrice!

1563
01:36:22,487 --> 01:36:25,532
What fresh hell is this?

1564
01:36:25,615 --> 01:36:26,574
Beatrice!

1565
01:36:26,658 --> 01:36:29,577
It is I, your knight
in shining armor.

1566
01:36:32,914 --> 01:36:36,042
You can't be serious.

1567
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:39,546
Darling, suspend
what you know to be true.

1568
01:36:39,629 --> 01:36:41,631
Just...

1569
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:44,926
Just-just go with it.

1570
01:36:47,011 --> 01:36:49,013
Oh, no. He's gonna sing.

1571
01:36:52,725 --> 01:36:54,143
-

1572
01:36:56,145 --> 01:36:58,314
You really don't
have to do this.

1573
01:36:58,398 --> 01:36:59,691
But I do, darling.

1574
01:36:59,774 --> 01:37:01,442
This is exactly what you wanted.

1575
01:37:01,526 --> 01:37:02,944
Nope. No. Not really.

1576
01:37:10,285 --> 01:37:11,828
Everybody.

1577
01:37:14,038 --> 01:37:15,748
-

1578
01:37:15,832 --> 01:37:17,458
-Oh, my God.
-

1579
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:19,127
Okay,
that's enough. That's enough.

1580
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:20,211
Yes. Thank you.

1581
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:22,922
Oh. Big finish.

1582
01:37:38,771 --> 01:37:42,942
-

1583
01:37:43,026 --> 01:37:45,278
-

1584
01:37:45,361 --> 01:37:47,864
BEATRICE:

1585
01:37:47,947 --> 01:37:49,824
-Oh, my love.

1586
01:37:51,034 --> 01:37:52,827
Oh. Can I come up?

1587
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,203
Yes, if you can get
your armor off.

1588
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:09,469
Pack your bags.

1589
01:38:10,845 --> 01:38:12,680
-Huh?
-

1590
01:38:12,764 --> 01:38:13,765
Huzzah!

1591
01:38:16,309 --> 01:38:17,935
-ROBERT: Yes!
-

1592
01:38:19,395 --> 01:38:21,022
-ROBERT: Mother? Father?
-In here,

1593
01:38:21,105 --> 01:38:22,440
being immortalized.

1594
01:38:22,523 --> 01:38:24,567
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

1595
01:38:24,651 --> 01:38:26,527
-I'm Ella.
-Now, how lovely.

1596
01:38:26,611 --> 01:38:29,113
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

1597
01:38:29,197 --> 01:38:30,865
You're the statue girl.

1598
01:38:30,948 --> 01:38:32,325
That wasn't me.

1599
01:38:32,408 --> 01:38:34,369
Yes, it was.
I'm good with faces.

1600
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:36,746
So, do I have
a wedding to prepare?

1601
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:38,498
I mean, no pressure,

1602
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:40,166
but there's an absurd amount
of pastries

1603
01:38:40,249 --> 01:38:41,793
left over from that ball.

1604
01:38:41,876 --> 01:38:43,836
No, no, we're not in a rush
to get married.

1605
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,713
Uh, instead, we're going to
travel the world together.

1606
01:38:45,797 --> 01:38:47,632
Ah. Hmm.

1607
01:38:47,715 --> 01:38:49,133
I'm sorry if
my decision disrupts

1608
01:38:49,217 --> 01:38:50,843
-your plans for succession.
-Well, that's all right.

1609
01:38:50,927 --> 01:38:54,972
It just so happens I share blood
with another who, one day,

1610
01:38:55,056 --> 01:38:57,975
will be the greatest leader
the realm has ever known.

1611
01:38:58,059 --> 01:38:59,811
Hear that, Gwen?

1612
01:39:01,312 --> 01:39:02,855
What's happening?

1613
01:39:02,939 --> 01:39:04,732
-Gwen, my darling girl.
-

1614
01:39:04,816 --> 01:39:09,320
I hereby place you first in line
to inherit the crown, hmm?

1615
01:39:09,404 --> 01:39:11,030
Don't stab me in my sleep.

1616
01:39:12,365 --> 01:39:14,784
I... shall be king?

1617
01:39:14,867 --> 01:39:16,035
Eh, queen.

1618
01:39:16,119 --> 01:39:18,246
I'll take it.

1619
01:39:18,329 --> 01:39:19,539
Good.

1620
01:39:23,418 --> 01:39:25,920
Just so we're clear,
I'm going to rule the land?

1621
01:39:26,003 --> 01:39:28,172
-Yes.
-Okay.

1622
01:39:29,549 --> 01:39:30,883
And everyone heard that?

1623
01:39:30,967 --> 01:39:32,301
-We did. Yes.
-Yes. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1624
01:39:32,385 --> 01:39:34,262
Oh!

1625
01:39:34,345 --> 01:39:36,514
So many ideas!

1626
01:39:36,597 --> 01:39:39,559
Like... Oh, I don't know
where to begin!

1627
01:39:39,642 --> 01:39:41,185
Oh, good.
Can I take this crown off?

1628
01:39:41,269 --> 01:39:42,729
-Yes.
-Shall we have some tea?

1629
01:39:44,147 --> 01:39:45,857
GWEN:
It is my honor

1630
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:49,318
to guide this kingdom forward
into a new era.

1631
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:52,363
And to pay my deepest respects
to my brother,

1632
01:39:52,447 --> 01:39:55,199
Prince Robert, and his new...

1633
01:39:56,909 --> 01:39:58,536
What are we calling you?

1634
01:39:58,619 --> 01:40:00,079
Well...

1635
01:40:00,163 --> 01:40:02,206
I mean, we don't have to put
a label on it.

1636
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:03,916
Just... in love?

1637
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,168
I don't know.

1638
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:06,961
In love?

1639
01:40:07,044 --> 01:40:09,005
Yeah.

Ella.

I believe this belongs to you.

1644
01:40:31,861 --> 01:40:33,571
My mother's brooch.

1645
01:40:33,654 --> 01:40:35,865
I thought it could inspire you
on your voyage.

1646
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:37,366
Thank you.

1647
01:40:38,785 --> 01:40:40,620
All right, that's enough mirth.
Celebration's over.

1648
01:40:40,703 --> 01:40:42,413
-Everyone, go home.

-Come on. Let's go.
-No!

1651
01:40:49,462 --> 01:40:51,255
You're wrong!

FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
And so we've reached

1689
01:45:41,879 --> 01:45:43,756
the end of this fairy tale.

1690
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:46,050
Our girl lived
happily ever after,

1691
01:45:46,133 --> 01:45:48,260
and everybody knew her name.

1692
01:45:48,344 --> 01:45:49,887
Ella.

1693
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:51,722
The girl's name is Ella, y'all.

1694
01:45:51,806 --> 01:45:53,265
Get it right.

the whispers

I know who I'm gonna be

1702
